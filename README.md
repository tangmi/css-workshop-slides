# CSS workshop

These are the slides for my CSS workshop people wanted me to teach.

This class was (will be) taught on 3/30/2013 at [StudentRND](http://www.studentrnd.org/).

### This slide deck

* Runs on [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/)
* Uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with (deck.js-markdown)[https://github.com/tmbrggmn/deck.js-markdown]
* Is actually a (only referring to the code I wrote for it) very bad example of how to do CSS.
* Probably is missing a lot of important points.

*Note: for the examples to load correctly, the page needs to be viewed on a server (locally works)*
